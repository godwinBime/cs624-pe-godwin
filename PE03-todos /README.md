Input:  
When the app first runs, the user is presented with a text input field to create a list of projects to complete one at a time. 

Process:  
When the user emters the name of the name of the todo job, the use proceeds to click the submit button. If the process is successsful, the todo task gets stored in a todo array. Once stored, the todo taks gets displayed immidiately below the submit button. The todo list then displays two buttons (Done, Delete) that the user can click either to mark the task as completed or delete the task all together. At the botton of the app, there is a tab bar with three buttons labeled "All, Active, Completed". When the user clicks the done button, the button color changes to green.

Output:                       
Once the user adds an item into the todo list, by default all the task are displayed in the "All" tab bar. The user can then filter through the other tabs to see the active task, the completed tasks or return to the "All" tab to view all the tasks both active and completed.
